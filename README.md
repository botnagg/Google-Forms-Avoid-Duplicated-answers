Hi!
This script is made to avoid DUPLICATED ANSWERS in Google Forms; made in GOOGLE APPSCRIPT.
It is usefull when you don't want to get the same answers in the same question, to not get duplicad answers.
***All you need is to change the values that are in capital letters, the id of the link is what is between /d/ and /edit https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/HERE/edit#gid=970419893
I had to make the script myself i hope i can help another people that needs this.
Best of wishes,
Nag.
